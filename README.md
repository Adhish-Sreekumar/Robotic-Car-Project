# Robotic-Car-Project
This project explores the intersection of robotics and sensor technologies to enhance transportation safety. Using the Arduino Uno platform, we developed a robotic car capable of autonomous navigation and real-time accident detection. 
# The key features include:
Ultrasonic Sensors: For obstacle detection and avoidance.
IR Sensors: Ensuring precise path following.
Vibration Sensor SW420: For detecting accidents.
Buzzer: Providing immediate alerts in case of an accident.
# Key Objectives:
Develop a cost-effective robotic car with advanced safety features.
Utilize accessible technology like Arduino to democratize autonomous vehicle development.
Contribute to safer and more inclusive transportation solutions.
# How It Works:
The robotic car uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles, IR sensors for path guidance, and a vibration sensor to detect accidents. In case of an accident, the buzzer sounds an alert.
